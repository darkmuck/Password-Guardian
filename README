Password Guardian is a secure PHP password manager.

It stores all your data fully encyrpted. It's recommended to use this on an SSL-enabled host for maximum security.

Warning: This software is in pre-alpha stage. Everything should work as expected, but bugs/vulnurabilities/etc are quite possible. Pull requests are welcome.

Quick installation instructions:
- Import db.sql to MySQL
- Insert the following to the "settings" table:
  - Key: UserName, Value: <your username>
  - Key: UserPassword, Value: sha1sum(<your password>)
  - Key: MasterPassword, Value sha1sum(<master password for encryption>)

- Edit application/config/config.php
  - Set $config['base_url']
  - Set $config['password_salt'] (at the very bottom)

That's it :) Usage should be pretty self explanatory.

Upcoming features:
- Setup script (Almost done)
- i18n (No ETA)
- CSV export (NO ETA)
- Password generator (Almost done)
- An actual theme! (WIP)

For feature requests, please open a new issue on Github.

Enjoy :)
